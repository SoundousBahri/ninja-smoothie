        <h5>Hello and welcome to Ninja Smoothies!</h5>

        <p>This Project is a sample application built using VueJs and deployed on firebase.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>This web app permits users to create smoothies, browse their smoothies, update or delete them.
          The user can see other users on a map and visit their profiles to see their smoothies and give them a like.
          The web app uses geolocation API to get the user's location on the map if he gives his permission, otherwise, he will get a default random location.</p>
